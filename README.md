# Flex
Map Elasticsearch results to Eloquent models. 

Flex is a Laravel package compatible with Laravel 4.2. It's based on the excellent
Fadion/Bouncy package. I wrote Flex to overcome the limitations of Bouncy and make it compatible with Elasticsearch 2.0. Flex 
is in development at the moment, so do not use in production.
